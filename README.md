# Digital-Analog-clock

## 📜 Project Overview
This project is a **Digital-Analog Clock** built using web technologies. It displays the current time both **digitally** (numbers) and **analogically** (with moving clock hands), providing a real-time, visually appealing clock for users.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Updates** — The clock updates every second without any delay.
- **Digital Clock Display** — Shows the current hours, minutes, and seconds numerically.
- **Analog Clock Display** — Smooth-moving hour, minute, and second hands on a traditional clock face.
- **Responsive Design** — Works on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Simple and Clean UI** — Minimalistic and attractive design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** — For the structure of the clock.
- **CSS** — For styling the clock face, hands, and digital display.
- **JavaScript** — For dynamic functionality to calculate and update the time.

## 🎯 How It Works
- JavaScript gets the current time using the `Date` object.
- For the **digital clock**, hours, minutes, and seconds are displayed as text.
- For the **analog clock**, CSS transforms are applied to rotate the hour, minute, and second hands according to the current time.
